# Why Your React App Can't Render OG Tags Like Next.js

## The Core Problem

### What You Have (Create React App):
```
User visits /movie/123
  ↓
Server sends index.html (with generic meta tags)
  ↓
JavaScript executes
  ↓
React Router renders MovieDetailPage
  ↓
React Helmet adds dynamic meta tags (via JavaScript)
  ↓
BUT: Facebook's crawler doesn't execute JavaScript! ❌
```

### What Next.js Has (Built-in SSR):
```
User visits /movie/123
  ↓
Server fetches movie data
  ↓
Server generates HTML with movie-specific meta tags
  ↓
Server sends complete HTML (meta tags already in <head>)
  ↓
Facebook crawler reads static HTML ✅
```

## Why React SPA Fails for OG Tags

**Problem 1: Meta Tags Added by JavaScript**
- Your movie-specific tags are added by `React Helmet` (JavaScript)
- Facebook crawlers don't execute JavaScript
- They only see the static HTML from `index.html`

**Problem 2: Client-Side Routing**
- All routes serve the same `index.html`
- Facebook sees the same generic meta tags for every URL
- No way to customize meta tags per route on the server

**Problem 3: No Server-Side Rendering**
- Create React App is a Single Page Application (SPA)
- HTML is generated in the browser, not on the server
- Social media crawlers get empty/ generic HTML

## Why Next.js Works Perfectly

**Built-in SSR**:
```javascript
// In Next.js, this runs on the server
export default function MoviePage({ movie }) {
  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <title>{movie.title}</title>
        <meta property="og:title" content={movie.title} />
        <meta property="og:image" content={movie.poster} />
      </Head>
      <div>Movie content...</div>
    </>
  )
}

// Meta tags are in the HTML BEFORE it's sent to the browser
```

## What You Can Do Now (Without Migrating)

### Option 1: Accept Generic OG Tags (Current State)
- All pages show "MovieStream - Premium Movie Streaming"
- Same image for all pages
- Works, but not ideal

### Option 2: Enable Netlify Prerendering
- Netlify can crawl and cache your pages
- Generates static HTML with meta tags
- Requires manual configuration
- May not work for all routes

### Option 3: Migrate to Next.js (Best Solution)
- Built-in SSR
- Perfect OG tag support
- Easy migration path
- Industry standard

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | Create React App | Next.js |
|---------|------------------|---------|
| OG Tags | ❌ Client-side only | ✅ Server-side |
| Social Media | ❌ Generic preview | ✅ Dynamic preview |
| SEO | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Excellent |
| Setup | ✅ Simple | ✅ Simple |
| SSR | ❌ No | ✅ Built-in |
| Meta per route | ❌ Not possible | ✅ Easy |

## Recommendation

**For production with proper OG tags**: **Migrate to Next.js**

It's the industry standard for SEO-friendly React apps and handles OpenGraph meta tags perfectly out of the box.

## Current Status

✅ Your code is correct
✅ Meta tags are properly formatted
❌ Facebook can't see them (no SSR)

The tags are there, but Facebook's crawler never gets to execute the JavaScript that adds them!

---

**TL;DR**: React SPA = JavaScript renders meta tags = Facebook crawler doesn't see them ❌
Next.js = Server renders meta tags = Facebook crawler sees them ✅
