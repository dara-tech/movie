# Route Conflict - Resolved

## ⚠️ The Problem

Both React app and Next.js have `/movie/[id]` route:
- React: `localhost:3000/movie/[id]`
- Next.js: `localhost:3001/movie/[id]`

This causes conflicts when trying to navigate.

## ✅ Solution Applied

**Reverted to original React app routing:**
- Movie cards now navigate to `/movie/${movie._id}` in React app
- No route conflicts
- Original functionality restored

## 📊 Current Status

### What Works:
- ✅ React app movie pages work normally
- ✅ No conflicts
- ✅ Original navigation
- ❌ OpenGraph tags still don't work (React limitation)

### Next.js App:
- ✅ Built successfully
- ✅ Can run on different port
- ✅ Has working OG tags
- ⚠️ Not currently connected

## 🎯 Your Options

### Option 1: Accept React App (Current)
- **Pros**: No conflicts, everything works
- **Cons**: No OG tags for social sharing
- **Status**: Currently active ✅

### Option 2: Use Next.js for Movies Only
- **Pros**: Perfect OG tags
- **Cons**: Need to manage two apps, different URL
- **Setup**: Change MovieCard to open Next.js URL

### Option 3: Full Next.js Migration
- **Pros**: Best solution, perfect OG tags everywhere
- **Cons**: Takes time (6-8 hours)
- **Setup**: Migrate all features to Next.js

## 💡 Recommendation

**For now**: Keep current setup (Option 1)
- Everything works
- No conflicts
- Can add OG tags later

**Later**: Full migration to Next.js (Option 3)
- Better long-term solution
- Perfect OG tags
- Better performance

## 🔄 Want to Use Next.js?

If you want OG tags working now:

1. Update MovieCard.tsx:
```typescript
window.location.href = `http://localhost:3001/movie/${movie._id}`;
```

2. Run Next.js on port 3001

3. Movie pages will have perfect OG tags
