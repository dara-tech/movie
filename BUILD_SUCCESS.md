## 🚀 How to Deploy

### Option 1: Deploy to Netlify

1. **Build output is in**:
   ```
   client-nextjs/.next/
   ```

2. **Configure Netlify**:
   ```json
   {
     "build": {
       "command": "cd client-nextjs && npm run build",
       "publish": "client-nextjs/.next"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Deploy**:
   - Push to Git
   - Netlify will auto-deploy
   - Or manually deploy from folder

### Option 2: Use Vercel (Recommended for Next.js)

1. **Install Vercel CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel
   ```

2. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   cd client-nextjs
   vercel
   ```

## 🧪 Test Before Deploy

Run the built version locally:
```bash
cd client-nextjs
npm start
```

Visit: http://localhost:3000/movie/[movie-id]
