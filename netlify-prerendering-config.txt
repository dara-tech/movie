# Netlify Prerendering Configuration

## Issue: OpenGraph meta tags not showing for dynamic routes

## Root Cause
React apps with client-side routing don't render meta tags server-side. Social media crawlers (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) don't execute JavaScript, so they only see the static HTML from index.html.

## Solution: Enable Netlify Prerendering

### Option 1: Use @netlify/plugin-nextjs (Recommended)
1. Install the plugin:
   ```bash
   npm install @netlify/plugin-nextjs --save-dev
   ```

2. Add to netlify.toml:
   ```toml
   [[plugins]]
     package = "@netlify/plugin-nextjs"
   ```

### Option 2: Enable Netlify Prerendering
1. Go to Netlify Dashboard
2. Navigate to: Site settings > Build & deploy > Post processing
3. Enable "Prerendering"
4. Add these URLs to prerender:
   - /movie/*
   - /tvshow/*

### Option 3: Use Netlify Edge Functions (Advanced)
Create serverless functions that return pre-rendered HTML with meta tags.

## Temporary Workaround
For now, rebuild and redeploy your site with the updated index.html that includes default OpenGraph tags.

### Steps:
1. Run: npm run build
2. Deploy to Netlify
3. Clear Netlify cache
4. Test with Facebook Debugger: https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/

## Long-term Solution
Consider migrating to Next.js for built-in SSR support, which handles OpenGraph meta tags perfectly.
