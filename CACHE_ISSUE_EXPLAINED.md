# OpenGraph Cache Issue - Explained

## The Issue

Facebook is showing this warning:
> "The 'og:image' property should be explicitly provided, even if a value can be inferred from other tags."

However, your meta tags ARE correct:
```html
<meta property="og:image" content="https://visionary-lebkuchen-a7e181.netlify.app/placeholder-movie.jpg" />
```

## Root Cause

This is a **cache issue**, not a code problem:

1. **Stale data**: Facebook scraped 17 minutes ago
2. **Response 206**: Partial content from cache
3. **Old version**: Facebook is showing cached HTML without your latest changes

## Evidence

From Facebook Debugger:
```
Time Scraped: 17 minutes ago
Response Code: 206 (Partial Content from cache)
```

The Response Code 206 means Facebook is serving **cached content** instead of fetching fresh HTML from your site.

## Solution

### Force Facebook to Clear Cache:

1. Go to: https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/
2. Enter your URL: `https://visionary-lebkuchen-a7e181.netlify.app/movie/68fc58bdd4afa091954846af`
3. Click **"Scrape Again"** button
4. Facebook will fetch fresh HTML
5. The warning should disappear

### Why This Happens

Facebook caches OpenGraph data to:
- Reduce load on websites
- Improve performance
- Prevent abuse

When you update meta tags, Facebook doesn't automatically know about the changes. You need to manually trigger a re-scrape.

## Verification

After clicking "Scrape Again", you should see:
- ✅ Response Code: **200** (OK) instead of 206
- ✅ Time Scraped: **Just now** or current timestamp
- ✅ og:image appears in the properties list
- ✅ No warnings about missing og:image

## Current Meta Tags (Correct)

Your `index.html` already has:
```html
<meta property="og:image" content="https://visionary-lebkuchen-a7e181.netlify.app/placeholder-movie.jpg" />
<meta property="og:image:width" content="1200" />
<meta property="og:image:height" content="630" />
<meta property="og:image:alt" content="MovieStream - Premium Movie Streaming Platform" />
```

These are **perfect** - just need to clear Facebook's cache!

## Testing Steps

1. Ensure latest code is deployed
2. Go to Facebook Debugger
3. Enter the URL
4. Click "Scrape Again"
5. Verify Response Code is 200
6. Check og:image appears
7. Warning should be gone

## Alternative: URL Parameter Trick

To bypass cache programmatically, you can add a version parameter:

Original URL:
```
https://visionary-lebkuchen-a7e181.netlify.app/movie/68fc58bdd4afa091954846af
```

With cache buster:
```
https://visionary-lebkuchen-a7e181.netlify.app/movie/68fc58bdd4afa091954846af?v=1
```

Facebook will see this as a "new" URL and fetch fresh data.

## Summary

**Your code is correct!** ✅

Facebook just needs to **clear its cache** by clicking "Scrape Again". The warning will disappear once Facebook fetches the latest HTML with your og:image meta tag.
